## Overview

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) is the largest source of high-quality images on the internet.
Amateur and professional photographers give back by allowing their photos to be used [100% free](https://unsplash.com/license) for commercial and non-commercial usage.

They also provide a [fantastic API](https://unsplash.com/developers), which gives you access to millions of photographs and a variety of metrics.
As an [Unsplash contributor](https://unsplash.com/@leerob), I wanted to see how many times my photos have been viewed and downloaded.

## Getting Access to Unsplash

To gain access to the Unsplash API, you need to:

- [Create an account.](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account)
- Go to [your applications](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications).
- Click "New Application."
- Accept the terms of usage.
- Fill in the required details.
- Retrieve the access token for your new application.

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰ You now have access to make requests to the Unsplash API with your access token.

## Creating an environment variable

To securely access the API, we need to include the access token with each request.
We also _do not_ want to commit this value to git, so let's use an environment variable.

Since I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I can add the environment variable with the CLI.

```bash
$ vercel env add unsplash-access-token <value>
```

To use it when running locally, add it to your `.env` (or `.env.local`) file.

```bash
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_TOKEN=<value>
```

We can now reference the value via `process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` in our API route.

## Creating the API Route

Let's start by creating a new API Route at `pages/api/unsplash.js`.

We want to pull statistics for a given user and return the total number of downloads and views.
We can use the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-users-statistics) to retrieve this information.

_Bonus_: We can cache the API Route with the [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.

```js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const accessToken = process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY;
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.unsplash.com/users/leerob/statistics?client_id=${accessToken}`,
    {
      method: 'GET'
    }
  );

  const unsplashdata = await response.json();

  res.setHeader(
    'Cache-Control',
    'public, s-maxage=1200, stale-while-revalidate=600'
  );

  return res.status(200).json({
    downloads: unsplashdata.downloads.total,
    views: unsplashdata.views.total
  });
}
```

## Example

The two cards below talk to `/api/unsplash` and pull back stats about my Unsplash account.
