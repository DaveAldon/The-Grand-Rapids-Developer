I've got two tricks for you today that help add some polish to any app or game with repetitive audio, or that needs any volume controls.

1. If your game has a lot of repetitive audio, you can add a small amount of randomness to the pitch to make it sound more natural. This is **super** useful for footsteps, weapon sounds, or anything that has to play over and over.

2. If your game has a volume control (it better have one!), keep in mind how volume works. It's not linear, it's logarithmic. A lot of libraries out there, and even basic implementations in Unity, will handle this, but can easily slip through the cracks.

I've included a [Mac compatible build](https://github.com/DaveAldon/Unity3D-Audio-Tricks/releases/tag/mac-build) with a simple scene that demonstrates these two tricks and how they can impact your game. You can try it out right now without needing to install anything.

### How to use the pitch trick

Essentially, whenever you call your audio clip to play, include a pitch value that is slightly randomized. Here's an example in C#:

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  private AudioClip shootSound;
  private AudioSource _audioSource;

  IEnumerator ShootProjectile()
  {
    while (true)
    {
      GameObject projectile = Instantiate(projectilePrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
      projectile.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().AddForce(transform.forward * projectileSpeed);

      if (shootSound != null)
      {
        // Random pitch value
        _audioSource.pitch = Random.Range(0.5f, 1.2f) : 1.0f;
        _audioSource.PlayOneShot(shootSound);
      }
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(shootInterval);
    }
  }
```

Above is with the built-in audio management in Unity. But there's other audio managers out there. One of my favorites is the [More Mountains Feels](https://feel.moremountains.com/) plugin. Pitch is just as easy to modify with this library. Here's example of setting up an options object that modifies a clip:

```csharp
  MMSoundManagerPlayOptions options;
  options = MMSoundManagerPlayOptions.Default;
  options.Pitch = UnityEngine.Random.Range(0.5f, 1.2f);
  options.SpatialBlend = 1;
  options.AttachToTransform = transform;
  options.MmSoundManagerTrack = MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Other;
```

Make sure to run the Unity project in this repo and toggle the checkbox in the UI to hear the difference. Pitch makes a **huge** difference when you throw in repetition.

### How to use the volume trick

The volume trick depends on the audio manager you're using, and the slider values. I like to have a slider that goes from 0 to 100 with whole numbers, so I use a formula like this to convert it to whatever scale I need:

```csharp
  public void SetLinearVolume(float sliderValue)
  {
    float volume = sliderValue / 100f;
    AudioListener.volume = volume;
  }

  public void SetLogarithmicVolume(float sliderValue)
  {
    float db = -80 + (sliderValue * 0.8f);
    float volume = Mathf.Pow(10, db / 20);
    AudioListener.volume = volume;
  }
```

You could just as easily use a 0-1 scale, which is the default for Unity sliders. The important part is making sure that the **_entire volume slider is usable_**, and not just the first or last 10% of it. This is especially important for mobile games, where the user might not have super granular control over the slider.

### Conclusion

I hope these tricks were helpful for you! Some boilerplate stuff about the repo below:

1. The project was made with Unity3D `2023.2.7f1`
2. The UI uses TextMeshPro
3. The audio clip is some random free laser sound I found
4. Everything else is using built-in stuff
5. Source code for the full project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveAldon/Unity3D-Audio-Tricks)
